In browser extensions and other environments where scripts are known to be local, we can use a synchronous version of the CommonJS require() function to implement CommonJS module loading. This implementation is compatible with CommonJS modules without requiring any wrapping or other modification.

The current implementation is for use in Chrome extensions only. We are planning to add support for other browser extension platforms.
